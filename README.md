## ðŸ§¾ Project Description

This project focuses on the **complete ASIC design flow** of a small RISC-V processor core using industry-standard tools and methodologies. The goal is to implement, synthesize, and physically realize the **PicoRV32** processor in a 45nm CMOS technology using the **GPDK045** library.

The design process includes:

- **RTL-level synthesis** using Cadence Genus
- **Physical implementation** (floorplanning, placement, routing) using Cadence Innovus
- **Clock tree synthesis**, **power grid design**, and **timing closure**
- **Power and area optimization**, including experiments with:
  - Clock gating
  - Multibit DFFs
  - Leakage power reduction
  - Core utilization adjustment
  - Increased operating frequency
- **Design for Testability (DFT)** with scan chain insertion
- **Equivalence checking** using Cadence Conformal LEC

The project is broken down into a series of structured exercises, each focusing on a different aspect of digital IC design. Through these tasks, students gain practical experience with all major phases of ASIC development â€” from RTL to final layout.
